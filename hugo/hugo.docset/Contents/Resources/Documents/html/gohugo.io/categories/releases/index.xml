And all was mostly well until a Hugo user asked about anchor links. Which is, when you look into it, a slightly sad Markdown story. They have been talking about anchors in Markdown over at the CommonMark forum for the last six years, but it has come to nothing.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.62.1: A couple of Bug Fixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.62.1-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.62.1-relnotes/</guid><description>This release is mainly motivated by getting this demo site up and running. It demonstrates truly portable Markdown links and images, whether browsed on GitHub or deployed as a Hugo site.

This version brings Markdown Render Hooks. This gives you full control over how links and images in Markdown are rendered without using any shortcodes. With this, you can get Markdown links that work on both GitHub and Hugo, resize images etc. It is a very long sought after feature, that has been hard to tackle until we got Goldmark, the new Markdown engine, by @yuin.</description></item><item><title>40K GitHub Stars Edition</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.61.0-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.61.0-relnotes/</guid><description>This is the 40K GitHub Stars Edition. It's mostly a bug fix release, and an important note is the deprecation of Amber and Ace as template engines. See #6609 for more information.
This release represents 10 contributions by 3 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, which has received 5 contributions by 4 contributors. A special thanks to @YuriyOborozhnyi, @bep, @Flogex, and @atishay for their work on the documentation site.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.60.1: A couple of Bug Fixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.60.1-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.60.1-relnotes/</guid><description>This is a bug-fix release with a couple of important fixes.

It's CommonMark compliant and GitHub flavored, and both fast and flexible. Blackfriday, the old default, has served us well, but there have been formatting and portability issues that were hard to work around. The &amp;ldquo;CommonMark compliant&amp;rdquo; part is the main selling feature of Goldmark, but with that you also get attribute syntax on headers and code blocks (for code blocks you can turn on/off line numbers and highlight line ranges), strikethrough support and an improved and configurable implementation of TableOfContents.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.59.1: A couple of Bug Fixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.59.1-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.59.1-relnotes/</guid><description>This is a bug-fix release with a couple of important fixes.

It is now possible to set the target format and the background fill color when processing images, e.g.:
{{ $image.Resize &amp;quot;600x jpg #b31280&amp;quot; }} See Image Processing Options.
Another useful addon is the $pages.Next and $pages.Prev methods on the core page collections in Hugo.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.58.3: A couple of Bug Fixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.58.3-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.58.3-relnotes/</guid><description>This is a bug-fix release with a couple of important fixes.

This means that you now can do variations of this:
{{$blurryGrayscale:=$myimage.Resize&amp;#34;300x200&amp;#34;|images.Filterimages.Grayscale(images.GaussianBlur8)}} {{$exif:=$myimg.Exif}} It's worth noting that the issue that enabled/triggered the implementation of the above was the simplifications needed to fix #5903, which makes sure that type information is preserved when processed via Hugo Pipes.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.57.2: A couple of Bug Fixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.57.2-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.57.2-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo 0.57.0 had some well-intended breaking changes.

And more.
Cascading Front Matter: We have added a new and powerful cascade keyword to Hugo's front matter. This can be added to any index node in _index.md. Any values in cascade will be merged into itself and all the descendants.
title:&amp;#34;My Blog&amp;#34;icon:&amp;#34;world.png&amp;#34;cascade:icon:&amp;#34;flag.png&amp;#34;outputs:[&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;]type:&amp;#34;blog&amp;#34;It's worth noting that the cascade element itself will also be merged. Also, to grasp the full value of this feature, remember that front matter in Hugo is both data and behaviour: You can tell Hugo how to process a subset of the pages (some example keywords are layout, type, outputs, weight) using the cascade keyword, e.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.56.3: A couple of Bug Fixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.56.3-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.56.3-relnotes/</guid><description>This is a bug-fix release with a couple of important fixes. After getting feedback about the new Hugo Modules feature, this release also adds some minor improvements:
It adds support for overlapping file mounts, even for the filesystems where we walk down the directory structure. One relevant example that is fixed by this release:
[module] [[module.mounts]] source=&amp;#34;content1&amp;#34; target=&amp;#34;content&amp;#34; [[module.mounts]] source=&amp;#34;content2&amp;#34; target=&amp;#34;content/docs&amp;#34; The above is obviously both common and very useful.

Hugo Deploy is implemented by @vangent and brings built-in deployment support for GCS, S3, or Azure using the Hugo CLI. See the Hugo Deploy Documentation for more information.
Hugo Modules is very much a community effort on the design and specification side, but @bep has driven the implementation.

There have been reports about infrequent paginator crashes when running the Hugo server since 0.55.0. The reason have been narrowed down to that of parallel rebuilds. This isn't a new thing, but the changes in 0.55.0 made it extra important to serialize the page initialization.

The main new features in this release are:
Config Dir: You can now split your configuration sections into directories per environment. Hugo did support multiple configuration files before this release, but it was hard to manage for bigger sites, especially those with multiple languages. With this we have also formalized the concept of an environment; the defaults are production (when running hugo) or development (when running hugo server) but you can create any environment you like.</description></item><item><title>And Now: Hugo 0.52</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.52-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.52-relnotes/</guid><description>The two big new items in this release is Inline Shortcodes and Consolidated File Caches. In Hugo we really care about build speed, and caching is important. With this release, you get much better control over your cache configuration, which is especially useful when building on a Continuous Integration server (Netlify, CircleCI or similar). Inline Shortcodes was implemented to help the Bootstrap project move their documentation site to Hugo. Note that this feature is disabled by default.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.51: The 30K Stars Edition!</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.51-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.51-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo reached 30 000 stars on GitHub this week, which is a good occasion to do a follow-up release of the great Hugo 0.50. This is mostly a bug fix release, but it also adds some useful new functionality, two examples are the new template funcs complement and symdiff. This release also continues the work on improving Hugo's error messages. And with .Position now available on shortcodes, you can also improve your own error messages inside your custom shortcodes:</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.50: Errors so Good, You’ll Want to Fail!</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.50-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.50-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo 0.50 brings greatly improved error messages, and we now also show them in the browser. Having error messages with filename, line- and column number greatly simplify troubleshooting. Many editors (like VS Code) even let you click and navigate directly to the problematic line. If your editor requires a different log format, you can set it via the HUGO_FILE_LOG_FORMAT OS environment variable:

This should simplify working with page bundles. One example of this would be how you now can create a new showcase for the Hugo web site.
But this release is also about collections. Go 1.11 gave us variable overwrite support in Go templates. That made it possible to simplify a lot of template constructs, but it also showed some limitations in Hugo's template functions.</description></item><item><title>This One Goes to 11!</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.48-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.48-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo 0.48 is built with the brand new Go 1.11. On the technical side this means that Hugo now uses Go Modules for the build. The big new functional thing in Go 1.11 for Hugo is added support for variable overwrites. This means that you can now do this and get the expected result:
{{$var:=&amp;#34;Hugo Page&amp;#34;}} {{if.IsHome}} {{$var=&amp;#34;Hugo Home&amp;#34;}} {{end}} Var is {{$var}} The above may look obvious, but has not been possible until now.</description></item><item><title>Two Bug Fixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.47.1-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.47.1-relnotes/</guid><description>This is a bug-fix release with two fixes.

It adds minification support for the final rendered output (run hugo --minify), but it is mostly a bug fix release. And most notably, it fixes a set of issues with live-reloading/partial rebuilds when running hugo server. Working with bundles should now be a more pleasant experience, to pick one example.
This release represents 35 contributions by 6 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @satotake, @anthonyfok, and @coliff for their ongoing contributions.</description></item><item><title>The Summer of Hugo</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.46-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.46-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo 0.46 is the closing credits to The Summer of Hugo. While most people have been relaxing on the beach, Hugo has been really busy:
0.42, June 12, 2018: Theme Composition and Inheritance! 0.43, July 9, 2018: Hugo Pipes! This was followed by some more technical follow-up releases. And today, when July has turned into August, we come with another one. It's not a big release. But with the big interest in Hugo Pipes, we felt that it was important to get this out there sooner rather than later.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.45.1: Two Bug Fixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.45.1-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.45.1-relnotes/</guid><description>This is a bug-fix release with a couple of important fixes (and one enhancement).

Before this release, the API was a little bit clumsy and the result potentially ambiguous in some situations.
Now you can simply do:
{{with.Site.GetPage&amp;#34;/blog/my-post.md&amp;#34;}}{{.Title}}{{end}} Or to get a section page:
{{with.Site.GetPage&amp;#34;/blog&amp;#34;}}{{.Title}}{{end}} We have also added a .GetPage method on Page and added support for page-relative linking.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.44: Friday the 13th Edition</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.44-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.44-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo 0.44 is the follow-up release, or The Sequel, of the very well received 0.43 only days ago. That release added Hugo Pipes, with SCSS/SASS support, assets bundling and minification, ad-hoc image processing and much more.
This is mostly a bug-fix release, but it also includes several important improvements.
Many complained that their SVG images vanished when browsed from the hugo server. With Hugo Pipes MIME types suddenly got really important, but Hugo's use of Suffix was ambiguous.</description></item><item><title>And Now: Hugo Pipes!</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.43-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.43-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo 0.43 adds a powerful and very simple to use Assets Pipeline with SASS and SCSS with source map support, PostCSS and minification and fingerprinting and Subresource Integrity and &amp;hellip; much more. Oh, did we mention that you can now do ad-hoc image processing and execute text resources as Go templates?
An example pipeline:
{{$styles:=resources.Get&amp;#34;scss/main.scss&amp;#34;|toCSS|postCSS|minify|fingerprint}} &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;stylesheet&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;{{$styles.Permalink}}&amp;#34; integrity=&amp;#34;{{$styles.Data.Integrity}}&amp;#34; media=&amp;#34;screen&amp;#34;&amp;gt; To me, the above is beautiful in its speed and simplicity.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.42.2: One Bug Fix</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.42.2-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.42.2-relnotes/</guid><description>This release fixes broken server-reload on config changes.

When his bass player had visited the bar a little too often, he started with his percussive piano playing to keep the tempo flowing. Oscar Peterson called it &amp;ldquo;Nat's stabilizers&amp;rdquo;. This release is the software equivalent of that. We have been doing frequent main releases this year, but looking back, the patch releases that followed them seemed unneeded. And looking at the regressions, most of them stem from the commands package, a package that before this release was filled with globals and high coupling.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.38.2: Two Bugfixes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.38.2-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.38.2-relnotes/</guid><description>This is a bug-fix release with a couple of important fixes:

It contains a few smaller bug-fixes, but more important is an overhaul of the API used to find images and other resources in your page bundles.
We have added two simple methods on the Resources object:
.Match finds every resource matching a pattern. Examples: .Match &amp;quot;images/*.jpg&amp;quot; finds every JPEG image in images and .Match &amp;quot;**.jpg&amp;quot; finds every JPEG image in the bundle. .GetMatch finds the first resource matching the pattern given.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.33: The New Kinder Surprise!</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.33-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.33-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo `0.33` is the first main Hugo release of the new year, and it is safe to say that [@bep](https://github.com/bep) has turned off his lazy Christmas mode 😃 This is a full makeover of the layout selection logic with full custom layout and type support (many have asked for this).

Hugo is very fast, but it is still possible to write ineffective templates. Now these should be easy to identify. Just run:

The real reason this release comes so fast after the last one is to change the default value for the new noHTTPCache flag, which gives away too much performance to make sense as a default value.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.28: High-speed Syntax Highlighting!</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.28-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.28-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo `0.28` brings **blistering fast and native syntax highlighting** from [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) ([fb33d828](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/fb33d8286d78a78a74deb44355b621852a1c4033) [@bep](https://github.com/bep) [#3888](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3888)).

With this release you can configure permalinks with sections like this:

This was a side-effect of the big new Custom Output Format feature in 0.20, and while the change was intentional and there was an ongoing discussion about fixing it in #3273, it did break some themes. There were valid workarounds for these themes, but we might as well get it right.
The most obvious use case for this is inline CSS styles, which you now can do without having to name your partials with a html suffix.</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.20.1</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.20.1-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 13:53:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.20.1-relnotes/</guid><description> Fix logic for base template in work dir vs in the theme #3323 camelCased templates (partials, shortcodes etc.) not found #3333 Live-reload fails with _index.md with paginator #3315 rssURI WARNING always shown #3319</description></item><item><title>Hugo 0.20</title><link>https://gohugo.io/news/0.20-relnotes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2017 13:53:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/news/0.20-relnotes/</guid><description>Hugo 0.20 introduces the powerful and long sought after feature Custom Output Formats; Hugo isn’t just that “static HTML with an added RSS feed” anymore.
