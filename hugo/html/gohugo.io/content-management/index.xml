These terms are connected, and you also need to read about Page Resources and Image Processing to get the full picture.
The illustration shows 3 bundles. Note that the home page bundle cannot contain other content pages, but other files (images etc.) are fine.
&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt; The bundle documentation is work in progress. We will publish more comprehensive docs about this soon.</description></item><item><title>Syntax Highlighting</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/</guid><description>Hugo uses Chroma as its code highlighter; it is built in Go and is really, really fast &amp;ndash; and for the most important parts compatible with Pygments we used before.
Configure Syntax Highlighter See Configure Highlight.
Generate Syntax Highlighter CSS If you run with pygmentsUseClasses=true in your site config, you need a style sheet.
You can generate one with Hugo:
hugo gen chromastyles --style=monokai &amp;gt; syntax.css Run hugo gen chromastyles -h for more options.</description></item><item><title>Content Formats</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/</guid><description>You can put any file type into your /content directories, but Hugo uses the markup front matter value if set or the file extension (see Markup identifiers in the table below) to determine if the markup needs to be processed, e.g.:
Markdown converted to HTML Shortcodes processed Layout applied List of content formats The current list of content formats in Hugo:
Name Markup identifiers Comment Goldmark md, markdown, goldmark Note that you can set the default handler of md and markdown to something else, see Configure Markup.</description></item><item><title>Related Content</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/related/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/related/</guid><description>Hugo uses a set of factors to identify a page's related content based on Front Matter parameters. This can be tuned to the desired set of indices and parameters or left to Hugo's default Related Content configuration.
List Related Content To list up to 5 related pages (which share the same date or keyword parameters) is as simple as including something similar to this partial in your single page template:</description></item><item><title>Front Matter</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/</guid><description>Front matter allows you to keep metadata attached to an instance of a content type&amp;mdash;i.e., embedded inside a content file&amp;mdash;and is one of the many features that gives Hugo its strength.
Front Matter Formats Hugo supports four formats for front matter, each with their own identifying tokens.
TOML identified by opening and closing +++. YAML identified by opening and closing ---. JSON a single JSON object surrounded by &amp;lsquo;{&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;}&amp;rsquo;, followed by a new line.</description></item><item><title>Shortcodes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/</guid><description>What a Shortcode is Hugo loves Markdown because of its simple content format, but there are times when Markdown falls short. Often, content authors are forced to add raw HTML (e.g., video &amp;lt;iframes&amp;gt;) to Markdown content. We think this contradicts the beautiful simplicity of Markdown's syntax.
Hugo created shortcodes to circumvent these limitations.
A shortcode is a simple snippet inside a content file that Hugo will render using a predefined template.</description></item><item><title>Content Sections</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/</guid><description>A Section is a collection of pages that gets defined based on the organization structure under the content/ directory.
By default, all the first-level directories under content/ form their own sections (root sections).
If a user needs to define a section foo at a deeper level, they need to create a directory named foo with an _index.md file (see Branch Bundles for more information).
A section cannot be defined or overridden by a front matter parameter &amp;ndash; it is strictly derived from the content organization structure.</description></item><item><title>Content Types</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/types/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/types/</guid><description>A content type can have a unique set of metadata (i.e., front matter) or customized template and can be created by the hugo new command via archetypes.
What is a Content Type Tumblr is a good example of a website with multiple content types. A piece of &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo; could be a photo, quote, or a post, each with different sets of metadata and different visual rendering.
Assign a Content Type Hugo assumes that your site will be organized into sections and each section represents a corresponding type.</description></item><item><title>Archetypes</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/</guid><description>What are Archetypes? Archetypes are content template files in the archetypes directory of your project that contain preconfigured front matter and possibly also a content disposition for your website's content types. These will be used when you run hugo new.
The hugo new uses the content-section to find the most suitable archetype template in your project. If your project does not contain any archetype files, it will also look in the theme.</description></item><item><title>Taxonomies</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/</guid><description>What is a Taxonomy? Hugo includes support for user-defined groupings of content called taxonomies. Taxonomies are classifications of logical relationships between content.
Definitions Taxonomy a categorization that can be used to classify content Term a key within the taxonomy Value a piece of content assigned to a term Example Taxonomy: Movie Website Let's assume you are making a website about movies. You may want to include the following taxonomies:</description></item><item><title>Content Summaries</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/</guid><description>With the use of the .Summary page variable, Hugo generates summaries of content to use as a short version in summary views.
Summary Splitting Options Automatic Summary Split Manual Summary Split Front Matter Summary It is natural to accompany the summary with links to the original content, and a common design pattern is to see this link in the form of a &amp;ldquo;Read More &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; button.

Use ref and relref {{&amp;lt;ref&amp;#34;document.md&amp;#34;&amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt;ref&amp;#34;#anchor&amp;#34;&amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt;ref&amp;#34;document.md#anchor&amp;#34;&amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt;ref&amp;#34;/blog/my-post&amp;#34;&amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt;ref&amp;#34;/blog/my-post.md&amp;#34;&amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt;relref&amp;#34;document.md&amp;#34;&amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt;relref&amp;#34;#anchor&amp;#34;&amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt;relref&amp;#34;document.md#anchor&amp;#34;&amp;gt;}} The single parameter to ref is a string with a content documentname (e.g., about.md) with or without an appended in-document anchor (#who) without spaces. Hugo is flexible in how we search for documents, so the file suffix may be omitted.
Paths without a leading / will first be tried resolved relative to the current page.</description></item><item><title>URL Management</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/</guid><description>Permalinks The default Hugo target directory for your built website is public/. However, you can change this value by specifying a different publishDir in your site configuration. The directories created at build time for a section reflect the position of the content's directory within the content folder and namespace matching its layout within the contentdir hierarchy.
The permalinks option in your site configuration allows you to adjust the directory paths (i.</description></item><item><title>Menus</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/</guid><description>If all you want is a simple menu for your sections, see the &amp;ldquo;Section Menu for Lazy Bloggers&amp;rdquo; in Menu Templates.
You can do this:
Place content in one or many menus Handle nested menus with unlimited depth Create menu entries without being attached to any content Distinguish active element (and active branch) What is a Menu in Hugo?

The static files are served on the site root path (eg. if you have the file static/image.png you can access it using http://{server-url}/image.png, to include it in a document you can use ![Example image](/image.png) ).
Hugo can be configured to look into a different directory, or even multiple directories for such static files by configuring the staticDir parameter in the site config.</description></item><item><title>Table of Contents</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/</guid><description>Previously, there was no out-of-the-box way to specify which heading levels you want the TOC to render. See the related GitHub discussion (#1778). As such, the resulting &amp;lt;nav id=&amp;quot;TableOfContents&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt; was going to start at &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; when pulling from {{.Content}}.
Hugo v0.60.0 made a switch to Goldmark as the default library for Markdown which has improved and configurable implementation of TOC. Take a look at how to configure TOC for Goldmark renderer.</description></item><item><title>Comments</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/</guid><description>Hugo ships with support for Disqus, a third-party service that provides comment and community capabilities to websites via JavaScript.
Your theme may already support Disqus, but if not, it is easy to add to your templates via Hugo's built-in Disqus partial.
Add Disqus Hugo comes with all the code you need to load Disqus into your templates. Before adding Disqus to your site, you'll need to set up an account.</description></item><item><title>Multilingual Mode</title><link>https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/</guid><description>You should define the available languages in a languages section in your site configuration.
